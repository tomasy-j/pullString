POSTN	0	9606.ENSP00000369071	9606	Homo sapiens	POSTN	Periostin; Induces cell attachment and spreading and plays a role in cell adhesion. Enhances incorporation of BMP1 in the fibronectin matrix of connective tissues, and subsequent proteolytic activation of lysyl oxidase LOX (By similarity).
SERPINB2	1	9606.ENSP00000401645	9606	Homo sapiens	SERPINB2	Plasminogen activator inhibitor 2; Inhibits urokinase-type plasminogen activator. The monocyte derived PAI-2 is distinct from the endothelial cell-derived PAI-1; Belongs to the serpin family. Ov-serpin subfamily.
CXCL10	2	9606.ENSP00000305651	9606	Homo sapiens	CXCL10	C-X-C motif chemokine 10; Pro-inflammatory cytokine that is involved in a wide variety of processes such as chemotaxis, differentiation, and activation of peripheral immune cells, regulation of cell growth, apoptosis and modulation of angiostatic effects. Plays thereby an important role during viral infections by stimulating the activation and migration of immune cells to the infected sites (By similarity). Mechanistically, binding of CXCL10 to the CXCR3 receptor activates G protein-mediated signaling and results in downstream activation of phospholipase C-dependent pathway, an increas [...] 
IFNA1	3	9606.ENSP00000276927	9606	Homo sapiens	IFNA1	Interferon alpha-1/13; Produced by macrophages, IFN-alpha have antiviral activities. Interferon stimulates the production of two enzymes: a protein kinase and an oligoadenylate synthetase; Belongs to the alpha/beta interferon family.
